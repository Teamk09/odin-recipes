<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches can make a case for arguably the best sandwich there is.
    Its simplicity matched with its delicious taste makes it a staple for many children
    and busy adults alike.

    I remember having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before every basketball game I played
    in highschool. It was a great way to get the proper nutrients in myself before an
    athletic performance. Maybe try it next time before having a workout!
