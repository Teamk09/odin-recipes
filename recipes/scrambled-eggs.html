        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Scrambled eggs have been a beloved breakfast meal for as long as I can remember. My
            mom used to make them for me every morning before school. I would always eat them
            with ketchup. I still do.

            Scrambled eggs are one of my favorite recipes due to the simplicity, low labor,
            and great taste. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.
